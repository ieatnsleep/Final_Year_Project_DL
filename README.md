# DeepLearning_on_CreditCardFraudDetection

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This project explores the sophisticated realm of credit card fraud detection using deep learning techniques. The aim is to build and refine models capable of identifying fraudulent transactions within a balanced dataset, mirroring the challenges faced in the real-world scenario where fraud instances are significantly less frequent compared to legitimate transactions. Through this project, I've delved into the nuances of applying deep learning methods to a critical financial security issue, showcasing my ability to navigate complex data landscapes and extract meaningful insights.

## Skills Demonstrated:

### Data Preprocessing & Exploration:

Feature Scaling and Transformation: Applied StandardScaler to normalize the dataset, ensuring that our neural networks receive input data within an optimal numeric range.
Data Reshaping for CNNs: Innovatively adapted the dataset for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) application by reshaping the input data to include a channel dimension, a step outside the norm for tabular data.

### Predictive Modeling:

Deep Learning Models: Leveraged TensorFlow and Keras to construct multiple model architectures, including dense neural networks and CNNs, tailored for the task of fraud detection.
Model Optimization: Employed techniques such as dropout regularization and feature engineering adjustments to enhance model performance, culminating in a model with an accuracy of 99.93%.

### Statistical Analysis:
Comprehensive Model Evaluation: Beyond accuracy, utilized a suite of metrics and the confusion matrix to offer a rounded view of model effectiveness, particularly in handling class imbalances inherent to fraud detection tasks.

### Data Visualization:
Training Progress Visualization: Plotted training and validation loss over epochs, illustrating model learning dynamics and aiding in the identification of overfitting.
Confusion Matrix Analysis: Visualized confusion matrices to dissect model predictions, providing insights into true positive, false negative, and false positive rates for detailed performance assessment.

### Feature Engineering:
Advanced Techniques for Unbalanced Data: Explored and implemented strategies to address data imbalance, a common challenge in fraud detection, enhancing model sensitivity to fraudulent transactions.

### Cross-Validation:
Robustness Verification: Applied StratifiedKFold cross-validation to ensure model consistency and reliability across different subsets of the dataset, reinforcing the model's generalizability.
